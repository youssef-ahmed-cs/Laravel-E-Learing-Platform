Logging is a crucial part of any application for monitoring and debugging. Laravel provides a
 powerful and flexible logging system that is built on top of the popular Monolog library.
 This allows you to configure various logging
channels to process and store your logs in different ways.

Log Levels
Before we get into the types of logs, it's important to understand log levels. These levels are used to categorize the severity of a log message. Laravel supports the eight standard syslog levels, ordered from least to most severe:
debug: Detailed information that is useful for debugging.
info: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
notice: Normal but significant events.
warning: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
error: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action but should be logged and monitored.
critical: Critical conditions, e.g., component unavailable, unexpected exception.
alert: Action must be taken immediately, e.g., entire website down, database unavailable.
emergency: The system is unusable.
